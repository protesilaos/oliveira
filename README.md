## Oliveira syntax theme

A colourful, low-contrast syntax theme based on a 16-colour palette. Green is the most prevalent accent, followed by violet, and blue.

Development is currently limited to the Atom text editor. Oliveira comes in light and dark variants.

This is the theme's master repo. It contains everything that is **not** part of the published Atom packages.
